00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000 
Ampleforth Organics are passionate about their products and customers.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.000 
Martina and her team are responsible for connecting with customers and providing product demonstrations.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.100 
Martina decides to rollout mobile devices to make connecting easier.  

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.800 
When the team meet, they discuss how their mobile devices have changed the way they work.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.090 
It becomes clear that everyone in the team has had some mishaps.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800 
Kwame shares how he sent an unfinished email to a client accidentally. 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.000 
Jo shares they sent an embarrassing emoji to one of their longest standing suppliers. 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:49.900 
Martina explains a recent example where another person in the organisation forwarded an email containing sensitive information to one of their competitors.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:59.290 
The implications for careless communication can be very serious, leading to disciplinary action, legal issues, or financial penalties.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.120 
It can even cause significant damage to the reputation of you, your company and its customers and employees.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:23.100 
Sending or posting something embarrassing, obscene, damaging or illegal, whether you meant to or not, may breach company policies and violate workplace laws designed to protect people against things like discrimination and harassment.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.800 
The mobile devices enabled Martina and her team to sign up more customers than ever, and Jo patched up their relationship with their favourite customer.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:45.230 
By following a few key guidelines, Martina and her team can ensure they're taking the biggest steps towards being mindful of others, protecting themselves and their organisation.
